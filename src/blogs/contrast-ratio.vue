      <h1>Understanding Projector Contrast Ratio</h1>
      <p>Projector contrast ratio is the difference between the brightest white and the darkest black a projector can display, indicating image quality.</p>
  
      <h2>What is Contrast Ratio?</h2>
      <p>It's the ratio of the whitest white to the darkest black, with higher ratios producing clearer images.</p>
  
      <h2>Getting a Good Contrast Ratio</h2>
      <p>It depends on room lighting; darker rooms benefit from higher ratios, while lower ratios suit well-lit spaces.</p>
  
      <h2>Measuring Contrast Ratio</h2>
      <p>There are two methods: Full On/Off and ANSI Contrast Patterns, but they can be misleading.</p>
  
      <h2>Static vs Dynamic Contrast Ratio</h2>
      <p>Static ratio compares simultaneous bright and dark colors, while dynamic measures changing images over time.</p>
  
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Contrast ratio is crucial for image quality, but manufacturer specifications can be misleading.</p>

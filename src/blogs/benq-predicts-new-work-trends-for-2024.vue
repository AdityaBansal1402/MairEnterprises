    <h1>Work Trends 2024: The Rise of Smart Projectors in Meetings</h1>

    <p>Traditional business meetings are structured and formal – a world of suits and ties, of PowerPoint presentations in big stuffy board rooms. But increasingly employers are realizing this may not be the most productive way to do business.</p>

    <p>Modern businesses need tools to meet new age challenges. Employees who are geographically distant need to work as a unit. Collaboration and team results are more valued than individual performance. Connectivity is critical. These trends are reshaping both our workplaces and work practices, and new tools are needed. The traditional projector for wireless presentations has been a useful communication aid – but can it empower business to make meetings more efficient as new technology emerges?</p>

    <h2>Trends Shaping Modern Meetings</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mobile devices are welcome</strong>: In the past, mobiles have been frowned upon at meetings, yet 32% of millennials use smartphones and/or tablets to collaborate with colleagues at work. A smart projector, used for wireless mirroring, amps up communication even further. Now you can share ideas from your smart phone, via wireless projection.</li>

      <li><strong>Internet access is essential</strong>: Accessing the internet during business meetings helps make meetings more efficient. Decisions can be made on the spot. No delays waiting for information. A smart projector has an Android-based system and supports internet connectivity, so staff can access files on the cloud, or watch YouTube videos though Firefox browser embedded in Smart Projector. Your meeting just became more interactive – and interesting.</li>

      <li><strong>Video conferencing is the new norm</strong>: Calls with video are more engaging and effective – 94% of businesses say video conferencing increases productivity, and in a recent survey, 98% of respondents said video conferencing helps relationship-building. With employees working remotely and business becoming more global, video conferencing is now part of everyday business operations. A time saving, all-in-one meeting room solution is required – enter the smart projector.</li>

      <li><strong>Huddles are happening</strong>: Huddle spaces are on the increase, replacing traditional meeting rooms. They encourage dialogue and engagement – and are even more effective with technology that facilitates interactive discussion. In 2020, outfitting huddle spaces is more affordable than ever before.</li>

      <li><strong>There's a plethora of platforms</strong>: Platforms of all types are increasing. With a smart projector, you can switch platforms and/or presenters simply and quickly via wireless mirroring. That’s less meeting time lost.</li>

      <li><strong>Increased agility is required</strong>: Immediacy results in greater efficiency. With the smart projector, you can access files on the cloud and collaborate in real meeting time. Making informed decisions on the spot is easier when you can work on the same file in the cloud or access information from the internet.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These workplace trends mean businesses need new tools for wireless mirroring that are smarter – and the new generation of smart projectors is up to the task.</p>
